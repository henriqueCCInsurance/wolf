# Locked Contacts Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Description
The issue was that locked leads in Import List mode were being lost when navigating to other sections. When users locked leads in import mode and then moved to the guide section, the leads became "unlocked" and users were forced to select a single prospect to proceed.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **State Management Issue**: The BattleCard component only checked for a single prospect from the Zustand store, not for locked contacts from localStorage
2. **Navigation Flow Problem**: When navigating between sections, the locked contact data wasn't being properly maintained
3. **Component Initialization**: The BattleCard component didn't restore locked contacts from localStorage on mount

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced BattleCard Component (`/src/components/modules/BattleCard.tsx`)

**Added State Management for Locked Contacts:**
```typescript
const [lockedContacts, setLockedContacts] = useState<Contact[]>([]);
const [currentContactIndex, setCurrentContactIndex] = useState(0);
const [isMultiContactMode, setIsMultiContactMode] = useState(false);
```

**Added localStorage Recovery Logic:**
- Added `useEffect` to check for locked contacts on component mount
- If locked contacts exist, restore them and set appropriate state
- If no prospect is set but locked contacts exist, set the first one as the current prospect

**Added Multi-Contact Navigation:**
- Navigation controls to move between locked contacts
- Current contact index tracking
- Dynamic prospect updating based on current contact

**Added Contact Management:**
- `getCurrentContact()` - Gets the current contact from the locked contacts array
- `getCurrentProspect()` - Converts current contact to prospect format
- `handleNavigateContact()` - Handles navigation between contacts
- `handleUnlockContacts()` - Clears all locked contact data

### 2. Enhanced IntegratedCallPlanner Component (`/src/components/planning/IntegratedCallPlanner.tsx`)

**Added State Recovery on Mount:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const savedLockedContacts = localStorage.getItem('wolf-den-locked-contacts');
  if (savedLockedContacts) {
    // Restore locked contacts and set appropriate mode
    // Handle intelligence loading state
  }
}, []);
```

**Improved Navigation Flow:**
- Updated `handleProceedToGuide()` to properly handle locked contacts
- For import mode, set the first locked contact as the current prospect before navigating
- Only clear localStorage when explicitly switching modes, not on initial load

### 3. UI Enhancements

**Added Multi-Contact Navigation UI:**
- Contact navigation card showing current contact and total count
- Previous/Next buttons for navigating between contacts
- Unlock all contacts button
- Visual indicators for locked contact mode

**Contact Information Display:**
- Shows current contact name and company
- Contact counter (e.g., "1 of 5")
- Lock status indicator

## Key Features

### 1. Persistent State Management
- Locked contacts are stored in localStorage with key `'wolf-den-locked-contacts'`
- State is restored when navigating between sections
- Intelligence loading state is maintained

### 2. Multi-Contact Support
- Navigate between multiple locked contacts
- Each contact gets its own battle card
- Prospect data updates dynamically based on current contact

### 3. Seamless Navigation
- Users can navigate from Import List → Guide → Back to Planner
- Locked status is maintained across all navigation
- No data loss when switching between sections

### 4. Error Handling
- Graceful handling of malformed localStorage data
- Fallback to single prospect mode if locked contacts are invalid
- Console error logging for debugging

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Import List Mode with Locked Contacts
1. Navigate to Planner → Import List mode
2. Import CSV with multiple contacts
3. Lock contacts (either selected or all)
4. Navigate to Guide section
5. ✅ Contacts should remain locked and navigable

### Scenario 2: Navigation Between Sections
1. Start with locked contacts from import
2. Navigate to Guide → Back to Planner → Guide again
3. ✅ Locked state should persist throughout navigation

### Scenario 3: Multi-Contact Battle Cards
1. Lock multiple contacts from import
2. Navigate to Guide section
3. Use navigation controls to move between contacts
4. ✅ Each contact should have its own battle card data

### Scenario 4: Unlock Functionality
1. Have locked contacts from import
2. Navigate to Guide section
3. Click "Unlock All" button
4. ✅ All locked contact data should be cleared

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/modules/BattleCard.tsx` - Enhanced with multi-contact support
- `/src/components/planning/IntegratedCallPlanner.tsx` - Improved state recovery and navigation

## Technical Implementation Details

### localStorage Keys Used
- `'wolf-den-locked-contacts'` - Array of locked Contact objects
- `'wolf-den-company-intelligence'` - Company intelligence data
- `'wolf-den-intelligence-loading'` - Intelligence loading state flag

### Type Safety
- All new code is fully typed with TypeScript
- Contact interface used for type safety
- Proper error handling for JSON parsing

### Performance Considerations
- localStorage operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- State updates are batched where possible
- Component re-renders are minimized through proper state management

## Future Enhancements
1. Add contact filtering and search within locked contacts
2. Implement bulk actions for locked contacts
3. Add contact-specific intelligence caching
4. Implement contact priority ordering
