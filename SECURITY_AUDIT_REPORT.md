# W.O.L.F. Den Security Audit Report
Date: 2025-07-11

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was conducted on the W.O.L.F. Den application, identifying and remediating 6 critical vulnerabilities and implementing multiple security enhancements.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Critical - Authentication & Password Security ✅
**Issue**: Passwords stored using weak base64 encoding (btoa)
**Solution**: 
- Implemented PBKDF2 password hashing with 100,000 iterations
- Added password strength validation (12+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars)
- Implemented account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- Added session management with 8-hour expiry

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/utils/crypto.ts` (new)
- `/src/services/authService.ts`

### 2. Critical - Sensitive Data Exposure ✅
**Issue**: User credentials and sensitive data stored in plain text in localStorage
**Solution**:
- Implemented AES-256-GCM encryption for localStorage
- Migrated sensitive data to encrypted storage
- Moved session data to sessionStorage
- Added automatic data migration on app startup

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/utils/secureStorage.ts` (new)
- `/src/services/localStorageService.ts`
- `/src/utils/securityMigration.ts` (new)

### 3. High - Vulnerable Dependencies ✅
**Issue**: 6 known vulnerabilities in dependencies
**Solution**:
- Updated jsPDF from 2.5.1 to 3.0.1
- Replaced vulnerable xlsx package with secure CSV export
- Updated Vite to latest version
- Added zod and isomorphic-dompurify for validation

**Files Modified**:
- `/package.json`
- `/src/utils/secureExcelExport.ts` (new)
- `/src/utils/enhancedExportUtils.ts`

### 4. Medium - Input Validation & XSS ✅
**Issue**: Insufficient input validation and XSS prevention
**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive input validation utilities
- Added DOMPurify for HTML sanitization
- Implemented CSV validation to prevent formula injection
- Added file upload validation

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/utils/inputValidation.ts` (new)
- `/src/components/planning/ContactImporter.tsx`

### 5. Medium - CSRF Protection ✅
**Issue**: No CSRF protection implemented
**Solution**:
- Implemented CSRF token generation and validation
- Created secure fetch wrapper with automatic CSRF headers
- Added CSRF token storage in sessionStorage

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/utils/csrf.ts` (new)
- `/src/utils/crypto.ts`

### 6. Medium - Security Headers ✅
**Issue**: Missing security headers and CSP
**Solution**:
- Implemented comprehensive Content Security Policy
- Added all recommended security headers
- Created Netlify _headers file for production
- Added security meta tags to index.html

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/security/headers.ts` (new)
- `/public/_headers` (new)
- `/index.html`

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### Authentication Security
- Strong password hashing (PBKDF2, 100k iterations)
- Account lockout mechanism (5 attempts, 15-minute lockout)
- Session tokens with expiration
- Secure session storage

### Data Protection
- AES-256-GCM encryption for localStorage
- Automatic migration of legacy data
- Secure key storage in IndexedDB
- Data sanitization for all user inputs

### Network Security
- CSRF token validation for state-changing requests
- Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- HTTPS enforcement via HSTS
- XSS protection headers

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive sanitization for all input types
- File upload validation
- CSV formula injection prevention
- Email, phone, URL validation

## Recommendations for Further Security

1. **Backend Security**
   - Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
   - Add API request signing
   - Implement proper OAuth 2.0 flow for third-party integrations

2. **Monitoring**
   - Add security event logging
   - Implement anomaly detection
   - Set up security alerts

3. **Regular Updates**
   - Schedule quarterly dependency audits
   - Implement automated security scanning
   - Regular penetration testing

4. **Data Privacy**
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Add GDPR compliance features
   - Implement audit logging

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run `npm audit` regularly to check for new vulnerabilities
2. Test CSRF protection with various attack vectors
3. Validate CSP headers in production environment
4. Perform penetration testing on authentication flow

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run `npm install` to update dependencies
- [ ] Run `npm audit fix` to ensure no vulnerabilities
- [ ] Deploy _headers file to Netlify
- [ ] Verify CSP headers in production
- [ ] Test authentication flow with new password requirements
- [ ] Monitor for any security-related errors

## Summary

All identified vulnerabilities have been addressed with appropriate security measures. The application now implements defense-in-depth with multiple layers of security including proper authentication, data encryption, input validation, CSRF protection, and security headers.
