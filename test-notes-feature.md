# Live Call Assistance - Note-Taking Feature Test Plan

## Feature Implementation Summary

Successfully added a note-taking feature to the LiveCallAssistance component with the following capabilities:

### 1. Collapsible Notes Section
- Added below the Call Timer using the existing CollapsibleSection component
- Shows character count badge when notes are present
- Displays word count at the bottom

### 2. Auto-Save Functionality
- Notes are automatically saved to localStorage on every change
- Storage key format: `wolf-den-call-notes-${companyName}-${contactName}`
- Notes persist between page refreshes for the same prospect
- Notes are loaded when switching between prospects

### 3. Call Integration
- Notes are included in the call log when ending the call
- The first line of notes becomes the "bestTalkingPoint"
- The last line becomes the "keyTakeaway"
- Full notes are stored in additionalInfo.companyInsights
- Notes are cleared from localStorage after call ends

### 4. Dark Mode Support
- Textarea has proper dark mode styling:
  - Dark background (dark:bg-gray-800)
  - Light text (dark:text-gray-100)
  - Proper border colors (dark:border-gray-600)
  - Styled placeholder text (dark:placeholder-gray-400)

### 5. UI/UX Features
- Textarea is disabled when no call is active
- Resizable vertically for longer notes
- Focus states with primary color ring
- Informative helper text with FileText icon

## Testing Steps

1. Navigate to Live Call Assistance module
