- [x] Admin dashboard accessible

## Deployment Requirements

### Environment Variables
Create `.env.production` with:
```
VITE_API_URL=your-production-api-url
VITE_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### Hosting Requirements
- Node.js 18+ for build process
- Static file hosting (Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3 + CloudFront)
- HTTPS required for production

### Deployment Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.production
   # Edit .env.production with production values
   ```

2. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm ci
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deploy Options**

   **Option A: Netlify**
   ```bash
   # Install Netlify CLI
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   
   # Deploy
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
   ```

   **Option B: Vercel**
   ```bash
   # Install Vercel CLI
   npm install -g vercel
   
   # Deploy
   vercel --prod
   ```

   **Option C: AWS S3 + CloudFront**
   ```bash
   # Sync to S3
   aws s3 sync dist/ s3://your-bucket-name --delete
   
   # Invalidate CloudFront
   aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DIST_ID --paths "/*"
   ```

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Application loads at production URL
- [ ] Authentication works correctly
- [ ] All lazy-loaded modules load properly
- [ ] Console has no critical errors
- [ ] Performance metrics acceptable (< 3s initial load)

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Error tracking configured (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Analytics configured (e.g., Google Analytics)
- [ ] Performance monitoring enabled
- [ ] Uptime monitoring configured

### Security Checklist
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] CSP headers configured
- [ ] Environment variables secured
- [ ] API endpoints use authentication
- [ ] No sensitive data in client bundle

## Known Issues
- Bundle size warning for main chunk (824KB) - acceptable for initial release
- 36 ESLint warnings (mostly TypeScript `any` types) - non-critical
