# Interactive Map Implementation Test

## Features Implemented:

1. **Real Leaflet Map Integration**
   - Replaced placeholder with actual interactive OpenStreetMap
   - No API keys required - uses free OpenStreetMap tiles
   - Responsive and touch-friendly

2. **Color-Coded Pins by Call Outcome**
   - Green pins: Meeting Booked (successful)
   - Blue pins: Follow-up Scheduled (successful)
   - Yellow pins: Added to Nurture (neutral)
   - Red pins: Disqualified (unsuccessful)

3. **Interactive Pin Popups**
   - Click any pin to see:
     - Company name
     - Address (mock data)
     - Call outcome
     - Call date
     - Intelligence gathered (if available)

4. **Regional Filtering**
   - Dropdown to filter by US regions (Northeast, Midwest, West, South)
   - Map automatically adjusts bounds to show filtered pins

5. **Regional Statistics Cards**
   - Shows call distribution by region
   - Success rate calculation for each region
   - Visual indicators for performance

6. **Additional Features**
   - Custom SVG icons for better visibility
   - Map legend showing pin meanings
   - Automatic bounds fitting to show all pins
   - Professional styling with rounded corners and shadows

## Mock Data
The implementation uses mock geocoded locations across major US cities to demonstrate functionality. In production, this would integrate with a real geocoding service (Google Maps API, Mapbox, etc.) to convert actual company addresses to coordinates.

## Usage
Navigate to the "Analytics" section in EnhancedPostGame and click on the "Map View" tab to see the interactive map with all logged calls.
