Strategic benefits programs impact valuation through several channels: they reduce key-person risk by improving retention, demonstrate strong ESG governance that investors value, and create sustainable competitive advantages. For example, companies with strategic benefits see 23% lower voluntary turnover, which investors view as operational stability. Additionally, modern investors increasingly evaluate companies on their ability to attract and retain talent - especially in knowledge-based industries.
